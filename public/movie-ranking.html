<h1>The Best Movies According to Elias</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Void</h3>
<p>This movie is really awesome if you're into horror that's very up in your face.</p>

<h3>The Witch</h3>
<p>This movie is great if you like a slow burn with a lot of suspense.</p>

<h3>Blade 2</h3>
<p>I think the first and second Blade movies were really cool, but I've watched the second too many times to count. If you like action and gore together, this one's for you.</p>
